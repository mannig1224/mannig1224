ðŸ’» Full-stack web developer with a particular interest in front-end development and UX/UI

ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ Created lesson plans for elementary school-aged coders in South Africa

ðŸŒŸ With more than five years of software development experience, I have developed strong creative problem-solving skills, resource management skills, and communication skills. I am interested in combining those skills with web technologies to help build engaging and cutting-edge projects.

ðŸª¨ If I'm not programming, I'm likely rock-climbing and bouldering (v7, 11c), doing some sort of physical activity (lifting, pickleball), or video games (PokÃ©mon Apex or anything Nintendo).
